# RSC
Based on ESP32-based solution from https://github.com/imwitti/FootpodMimic

The setup is using a standard ESP32-board, with a Hall sensor (TW-492) attached to pin 26 (and 3.3V + GND from the board also). Pair with your phone and connect to the Zwift app to run online with others. The distance per revolution probably has to be adjusted to your threadmill. 

Use on your own risk.
